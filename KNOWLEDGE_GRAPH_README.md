cross_ministry = queries.find_cross_ministry_connections()
```

### Search for Specific Entities
```python
results = queries.search_entities("Adult Learning")
```

### Get Entity Connections
```python
viz = KnowledgeGraphVisualizer()
connections = viz.query_entity_connections("Adult Learning Program")
```

```python
influential = queries.find_influential_entities(top_n=20)
```

## 🎛️ Databricks Integration

The system is designed for **Databricks Apps** deployment:

- **Plotly** visualizations render natively in Databricks
- **Streamlit** apps can be deployed as Databricks Apps
- **Kuzu** database provides high-performance graph queries
- **NetworkX** offers advanced graph algorithms

### For Databricks Deployment:
1. Install dependencies: `plotly`, `streamlit`, `kuzu`, `networkx`
2. Upload CSV files to DBFS or workspace
3. Deploy Streamlit app using Databricks Apps
4. Configure cluster with appropriate libraries
