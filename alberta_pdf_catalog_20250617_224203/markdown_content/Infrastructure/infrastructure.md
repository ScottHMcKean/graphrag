## Our responsibilities

Alberta Infrastructure is responsible for delivering about one quarter of the Alberta government's [Capital Plan](https://www.alberta.ca/capital-plan) which is working to address the provincial infrastructure needs of Alberta’s population, and supporting key social programs and services, and economic development.

The Ministry designs, builds, manages and maintains government-owned and operated facilities, and collaborates with other ministries to ensure that school and hospital infrastructure meet the needs of Alberta’s population.

Infrastructure provides accommodation services and manages a large portfolio of owned and leased facilities while maintaining fiscal accountability and optimizing value for Albertans.
