#  Government Identity Program

The Government of Alberta’s brand standards and visual identity system. 

## Overview

The Government of Alberta (GoA) visual identity system gives all government communications, facilities, programs and services a unified and recognizable brand. Our logo – the Alberta Signature – is a foundational element. The visual identity system also defines the GoA approach to colours, typography and the other design elements.

## Standards

  * ![Cover page of the Visual Identity Manual](/system/files/styles/responsive_1040/private/custom_downloaded_images/visual-identity-corporate-identity-manual.jpg?itok=CQNWYngo)

Visual Identity Manual 

The manual helps us maintain brand consistency by providing standards and specifications for the use of the Alberta Government’s visual identity in a variety of situations. The rules outlined in the manual must be followed for all government communications, including stationery, forms, social media, websites, publications and signage.
