## Accomplishments

![](/system/files/styles/responsive_1040/private/custom_downloaded_images/blueprint-pillar-2-red-tape_rdax_750x422_75.jpg?itok=ze-HnqR6)

The first set of legislative changes, aimed at reducing regulatory burden on Alberta’s municipalities, has been passed with Bill 25 – the _Red Tape Reduction Implementation Act_.

![Construction worker with a hard hat holding a measuring tape in a wood framed structure under construction](/system/files/styles/responsive_1040/private/ma-construction-worker-card-750x422.jpg?itok=CSh9au1o)

Alberta is the first province in Canada to allow taller wood building construction. Advancements in fire protection and technology mean we can do so without compromising safety.

Since Spring 2019, the Safety Codes Council has been eliminating duplicative paperwork and moving services online where possible, including for appeals, accreditation applications, and permit administration.

The oil and gas sector can now rely on registered engineers to authenticate equipment rather than upgrade or alter existing equipment, or engage a third-party inspection agency.

Government is focused on protecting the rights of landowners and operators and ensuring fair and timely hearings. We have made an investment of $1.7 million in staff and board members for the Alberta Surface Rights Board.

## Key information

  * We are meeting our commitment to provide municipalities with predictable, long-term infrastructure funding by developing the _Local Government Fiscal Framework Act_.

  * funding supports for municipalities
  * a system that strives to ensure appropriate safety standards for the construction and maintenance of buildings and equipment
  * protections for new home buyers and required licensing for home builders
  * province-wide support for access to public library services for Albertans
  * safety codes, standards, and supports under the Safety Codes Act
  * management of about 2.6 million acres of public land in the province's three Special Areas
  * independent review and decisions on local matters by the Land and Property Rights Tribunal
