## Appeals

An appeal is when you ask for an appeal panel to review a decision Compliance and Monitoring has made. The appeal panel:

  * is made up of private citizens who are not Government of Alberta employees
  * has the authority and training to hear your appeal
  * may agree with, change or reverse Compliance and Monitoring’s decision



## Who can appeal

Any person who is affected by a decision made by Compliance and Monitoring under the [_Mental Health Services Protection Act_](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/m13p2), [Regulation](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/2021_114) and Standards, if it is a decision that can be appealed, as listed below.

## What can be appealed

Under the _Mental Health Services Protection Act_ , you have the right to appeal most decisions Compliance and Monitoring makes related to service providers.

The appeal panel can review decisions about:

  * refusing to issue, amend or renew a licence
  * the terms or conditions imposed on a licence
  * changing, suspending or cancelling a licence following an investigation
  * an inspector’s order
  * a notice of administrative penalty



For more information, review the act or contact the Appeals Secretariat.

## Steps to file an appeal

Make sure to file your appeal within the 15-day deadline from the date you got the written decision in person, by email or letter.

Fillable PDF forms may not open properly on some mobile devices and web browsers. See the [step-by-step guide](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/content/formopenhelp.html) or contact [PDF form technical support](/pdf-form-technical-support "PDF form technical support").

### Step 1. Complete a notice of appeal

#### Fill out an appeal form

  * Download and open the [Notice of Appeal Form](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/HCM12286) in Adobe Reader. Read the instructions, fill it in, and print it. Or, print a copy and fill it in.
  * Paper copies also are available from the Appeals Secretariat. Contact them to have it sent to you by mail or fax or email. When you get it, read the instructions and fill it in.
  * Make sure the form is signed.
  * Include an [Authorization Form](/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/appeals-secretariat-authorization-form.pdf "appeals-secretariat-authorization-form.pdf") if someone will be acting on your behalf throughout the appeal process.
  * Keep copies for your files.



### Step 2. File your notice of appeal

Make sure to:

  * include your signed Notice of Appeal form and the Authorization form if someone will be acting on your behalf
  * include a copy of letter with Compliance and Monitoring’s decision, if you received one
  * keep copies of all documents for your own files



Submit your documents:

  * scan and email them to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f98a9a8a8ad79889899c98958ab99e968fd7989bd79a98)
  * mail or fax them to the Appeals Secretariat office



### After you file an appeal

You will get a letter from the Appeals Secretariat saying they received your appeal. The Appeals Secretariat will start setting up your appeal hearing. Contact them, if you:

  * need an interpreter since all hearings are in English
  * want to get information about organizations that may be able to help you with your appeal
  * are waiting for any new information related to the appeal
  * want to withdraw your appeal
  * have moved or changed your phone number or email so they can reach you to give you the hearing date – if you do not take part when the hearing is scheduled, it may happen without you and your right to appeal will end



Find out what happens before, during and after the [appeal hearing](/addiction-and-mental-health-service-provider-licensing-appeal-hearing).

### Withdrawing an appeal

You can withdraw your appeal at any time. This means it is stopped and you no longer want to appeal Compliance and Monitoring’s decision. Tell the Appeals Secretariat as soon as you choose to withdraw your appeal.
