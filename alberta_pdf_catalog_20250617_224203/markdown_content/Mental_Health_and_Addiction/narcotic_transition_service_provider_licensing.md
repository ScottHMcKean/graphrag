## Overview

Narcotic transition service providers must meet all applicable quality, safety and other requirements and, unless otherwise exempted, be licensed under the [_Mental Health Services Protection Act_](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/m13p2) and the [Mental Health Services Protection Regulation](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/2021_114). In addition, service providers must meet all applicable requirements under the [Community Protection and Opioid Stewardship Standards](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/community-protection-and-opioid-stewardship-standards). For guidance on the regulatory requirements including licensing requirements and the licensing application process, review the following document: [Standard Operating Policy – Narcotic Transition Services](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/standard-operating-policy-narcotic-transition-services).

The regulation only authorizes a regional health authority like Alberta Health Services to be licensed and provide narcotic transition services.

Narcotic transition services use high potency opioid narcotics to treat patients with severe opioid use disorder who have been unable to initiate or stabilize on conventional opioid agonist treatment (OAT) medications. Under these highly specialized services, patients are stabilized on a high-potency opioid and provided comprehensive recovery-oriented supports. Best efforts are made to transition them under medical oversight to evidence-based opioid agonist treatment at the earliest possible opportunity.

This regulatory framework ensures narcotic transition services are provided with the most appropriate medical oversight. It supports movement to treatment and recovery, and protect communities against the harms of diversion.

The framework:

  * requires licensing, except in the following cases:
    * if high potency opioid narcotic drugs are not used (the use of buprenorphine, methadone and slow-release oral morphine is not impacted by the regulation)
    * if the purpose of using high potency opioid narcotic drugs is to treat a condition other than opioid use disorder, the regulation does not apply
    * if high potency opioid narcotic drugs are used in a hospital only to stabilize a patient with opioid use disorder during their treatment for a different condition, the regulation does not apply
    * if an existing patient of a licensed narcotic transition service provider requires continued treatment at a hospital, emergency department or a _Mental Health Act_ facility, those places do not need a licence but they do need to follow the regulation
  * ensures:
    * clinical oversight of patients is provided by an addiction medicine physician
    * best efforts are made to transition patients from high potency opioid narcotics to evidence-based OAT medications at the earliest possible opportunity
    * patients have service agreements and individual treatment plans developed in consultation with them
  * ensures service providers meet other standards such as policies and procedures for:
    * clinical practice standards
    * patient assessment
    * medication administration and prescriptions
    * referrals to other services such as detox, treatment and recovery services as well as primary health-care services
    * safety and security
    * employee requirements, qualifications and training
    * supporting patient success
    * patient absence, discharge and temporary exclusion from service provision
    * treatment of patients with dignity and respect
    * record creation, maintenance and retention
  * gives government authority to address complaints and concerns and to amend, suspend or cancel a service provider's licence



## Complaints or concerns

All licensed narcotic transition service providers in the province are required to have a complaint process.

It is recommended that service providers post the below poster in a visible location in each facility where the service is provided.

Download the [Compliance and Monitoring Complaints Hotline poster](/system/files/mha-safeguards-poster.pdf "mha-safeguards-poster.pdf")

If you have concerns about the services you or someone else is receiving from a narcotic transition service provider, start by raising it with your service provider first.

If your concern or complaint is still unresolved, contact us if it is about:

  * treatment or services received from a licensed service provider
  * suspected non-compliance with the _Mental Health Services Protection Act_ , Mental Health Services Protection Regulation, or Standards
  * suspicion that a service provider is offering or providing narcotic transition services without a licence under the _Mental Health Services Protection Act_



## Complaint resolution process

When you contact Compliance and Monitoring:

  * a complaints officer will collect the necessary details to follow up on your concern – have as much of the following information available as possible:
    * name and address (including municipality) of the facility or service provider
    * a brief summary of your concern or complaint and when it occurred
    * names, titles and contact numbers of people you have spoken to about your concern or complaint (for example, the manager, senior manager or board member) and their involvement in trying to resolve it
  * we will assess the risks associated with your complaint, and may conduct an investigation or contact other relevant authorities, or both, as required
  * you will receive a follow up letter with the outcome of your complaint
  * we will make every effort to protect your identity
    * Personal and health information is managed in accordance with the _Health Information Act_ and _Freedom of Information_ and _Protection of Privacy Act_.
