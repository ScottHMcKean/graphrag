## Overview

Supervised consumption service providers must meet all applicable quality, safety and other requirements and be licensed under the [_Mental Health Services Protection Act_](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/m13p2) and the [Mental Health Services Protection Regulation](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/2021_114). In addition, service providers must meet all applicable requirements under the [Recovery-oriented Supervised Consumption Services Standards](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/recovery-oriented-supervised-consumption-services-standards). For guidance on the regulatory requirements including licensing requirements and the licensing application process, review the following document: [Standard Operating Policy - Supervised Consumption Sites](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/standard-operating-policy-supervised-consumption-services).

This regulatory framework provides provincial oversight and standardization for supervised consumption services in Alberta. This ensures better community safety, higher quality services and improved integration with the health-care system.

The framework:

  * requires licensing
  * ensures service providers meet quality standards such as policies and procedures for:
    * clinical practice standards
    * referral pathways to detox, treatment and recovery services as well as primary health-care services
    * safety and security
    * employee requirements, qualifications and training
    * client rights and expectations for clients (for example, washroom access)
    * needle distribution
    * needle debris mitigation
    * record creation, maintenance and retention
    * community engagement
    * facilities or other locations where services are offered or provided
    * the collection, use and disclosure of personal information and individually identifying health information
  * gives government authority to address complaints and concerns and to amend, suspend or cancel a service provider's licence



## Licensed service providers

## Complaints or concerns

All licensed supervised consumption service providers in the province are required to have a complaint process.

It is recommended that service providers post the below poster in a visible location in each facility where the service is provided.

Download the [Compliance and Monitoring Complaints Hotline poster](/system/files/mha-safeguards-poster.pdf "mha-safeguards-poster.pdf")

If you have concerns about the services you or someone else is receiving from a supervised consumption service provider, start by raising it with your service provider first.

If your concern or complaint is still unresolved, [contact us](https://www.alberta.ca/residential-addiction-treatment-provider-licensing#contact) if it is about:

  * treatment or services received from a licensed service provider
  * suspected non-compliance with legislative requirements under the _Mental Health Services Protection Act_ , Mental Health Services Protection Regulation, or Standards
  * suspicion that a service provider is offering or providing supervised consumption services without a licence under the _Mental Health Services Protection Act_



## Complaint resolution process

When you contact us:

  * a complaints officer will collect the necessary details to follow up on your concern – have as much of the following information available as possible:
    * name and address (including municipality) of the facility or service provider;
    * a brief summary of your concern or complaint and when it occurred
    * names, titles and contact numbers of people you have spoken to about your concern or complaint (for example, the manager, senior manager or board member) and their involvement in trying to resolve it
  * we will assess the risks associated with your complaint, and may conduct an investigation or contact other relevant authorities, or both, as required
  * you will receive a follow up letter with the outcome of your complaint
  * we will make every effort to protect your identity
    * personal and health information is managed in accordance with the _Health Information Act_ and _Freedom of Information_ and _Protection of Privacy Act_.



If you have a concern about possible abuse, please contact the Provincial Abuse Line at [1-855-4HELPAB](tel:+18554435722) (443-5722).

## Apply for a licence

If you plan to start offering or providing supervised consumption services, contact us to begin the licensing process.

If you disagree with a decision made by Compliance and Monitoring regarding a supervised consumption services provider licence, you may be able to appeal it. Appeals are managed by the Appeals Secretariat, a neutral government office that operates separately from Compliance and Monitoring.
