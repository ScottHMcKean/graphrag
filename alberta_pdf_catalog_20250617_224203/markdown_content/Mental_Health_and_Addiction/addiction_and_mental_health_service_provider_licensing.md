## Introduction

Improved safety and quality of care are important for those who access regulated addiction and mental health services. The [_Mental Health Services Protection Act_](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/m13p2) and [Mental Health Services Protection Regulation](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/2021_114) establish licensing requirements and ensure core standards are met by service providers in Alberta that offer or provide:

  * [residential addiction treatment services](/residential-addiction-treatment-provider-licensing "Residential addiction treatment service provider licensing")
  * [supervised consumption services](/supervised-consumption-service-provider-licensing "Supervised consumption service provider licensing")
  * [narcotic transition services](/narcotic-transition-service-provider-licensing "Narcotic transition service provider licensing")
  * [psychedelic drug treatment services](/psychedelic-drug-treatment-service-provider-licensing "Psychedelic drug treatment service provider licensing")



Service providers have the [right to appeal](/addiction-and-mental-health-service-provider-licensing-appeal-decision "Service provider licensing – Appeal a decision") most licensing decisions made by the government.

Service providers/researchers who offer or provide psychedelic drug treatment services in the context of an approved clinical research trial do not need to obtain a licence. However, they are required to submit a report to the Alberta government of the approved clinical research trial. 

For more information, visit the [psychedelic drug treatment services page](/psychedelic-drug-treatment-service-provider-licensing "Psychedelic drug treatment service provider licensing").
