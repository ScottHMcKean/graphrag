## Overview

The Association Development Grant Program (ADP) is a closed operating grant program. The ADP helps support Provincial Sport Organizations (PSOs), Disability Sport Organizations (DSOs), and Multisport Service Organizations (MSOs) to deliver a wide range of sporting opportunities across the province.

The ADP grant provides funding in order to:

  * increase the number of Albertans participating in sport
  * encourage physical literacy, long-term athlete and lifelong participation
  * increase capacity across the sport system
  * support and develop quality coaches and officials
  * help Albertans strive for athletic excellence



Supporting PSOs, DSOs, and MSOs with annual operational funding enables these organizations to offer programs that increase Albertans lifelong participation in sport, and support coaches and officials.
