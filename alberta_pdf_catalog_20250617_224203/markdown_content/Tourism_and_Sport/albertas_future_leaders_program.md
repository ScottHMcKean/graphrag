## Overview

The Alberta's Future Leaders (AFL) Program collaborates with Indigenous host communities in northern Alberta to provide summer youth programming. Youth are engaged in sport, recreation, leadership and cultural activities by mentors living and working in the community.

Indigenous youth are empowered through sport and recreation programming that honours their heritage, fosters resilience and inspires youth to become positive leaders in their community.

The AFL program supports Indigenous host communities through inclusive and culturally relevant experiences in sport, recreation, and leadership programs that celebrate and honour traditional practises while creating opportunity for community engagement to inspire Indigenous youth to thrive.

## Program Framework

  1. Mentor Training and Orientation
     * Mentors undergo comprehensive training that equips them with the knowledge, skills and cultural sensitivity needed to work in host communities. This training provides tools on how to organize programming, build trust, establish meaningful relationships and communicate effectively with community members.
  2. Host Community Collaboration
     * Collaborating with Indigenous host communities involves building collaborative relationships to create youth programming that is based on mutual respect, trust and shared goals. This approach acknowledges strengths and contributions of mentors that seek to build capacity and increase opportunities for youth to participate in community developed programming.
  3. Programs, Camps and Trips
     * AFL mentors come from all backgrounds to share their positive attitudes, active lifestyles and to act as a positive role model to empower youth. From May to August, mentors plan programs, special events and out-trips focused on sport, recreation, leadership development and cultural activities.
  4. Leadership Retreat
     * Community liaisons and mentors select youth with potential to become future leaders from each host community. Attending leadership retreats allows candidates to build on essential leadership qualities, including communication, problem-solving, decision-making and teamwork. The leadership retreat offers youth an opportunity for adventure and challenges them to overcome obstacles and discover their strengths.
