## Introduction

We are looking for more foster parents – [just like you](https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=86485F3A59B30-D35D-9305-6200A9C2451FFE01) – to provide a stable, loving home to children in government care. It does not matter if you live in a city, small town or in the country. Foster parents can be single or have a partner, be in the midst of raising their own families, have no children, or be retirees whose children have grown and left home. You can be 20, 35, or 70 – age is just a number. If you have medical training to care for children with medical needs, or want to foster part-time, we also need foster parents like you.

If you want to make a difference in the life of a child, read our web content and call us at [1-844-957-0552](tel:18449570552), or email us at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0b6d64787f6e79686a796e6c627d62656c4b6c647d256a6925686a).
