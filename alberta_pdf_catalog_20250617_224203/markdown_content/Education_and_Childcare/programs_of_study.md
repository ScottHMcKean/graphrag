## Tools for parents

We recognize that parents play an important role in shaping the way their children view learning. As a parent, you understand more than anyone else how your child learns and processes information.

[New LearnAlberta Parents](https://curriculum.learnalberta.ca/parents/en/home) will provide you with a better understanding of Alberta's curriculum and related information for your child. This tool can help you discover what your child is learning, how they are assessed and what resources are available to help them be successful throughout their educational journey.
