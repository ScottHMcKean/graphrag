#  Refocusing health care in Alberta

Focusing Alberta’s health care system on providing consistent, timely access to care – when and where you need it.

  * [Albertans](/albertans)

## What will a refocused health care system mean for you?

Right now, the system gets in the way of health care delivery. It is complex and uncoordinated, resulting in unacceptable wait times, service disruptions and challenges accessing primary care.

What a refocused system means for you:

  * timely access to a primary health care practitioner 
  * shorter wait times for surgery and at the ER
  * consistent access to continuing care
  * expanded access to mental health and addiction treatment



We need to get you the right care when and where you need it.

To do this, we’re refocusing health care to create a more effective, unified system that prioritizes patients and empowers frontline health care professionals to support Albertans for generations to come.
