#  School Construction Accelerator Program

Building more classrooms now for Alberta’s growing communities. 

## Overview

Alberta’s population is growing rapidly as more people from across Canada and around the world choose to make the province their home. This rapid growth has put pressure on our K to 12 education system, with student numbers increasing at historic rates.

To meet this challenge, we introduced the School Construction Accelerator Program in 2024. With this program, we are making a generational investment to build more schools now for Alberta students and families.

By building and updating [Schools Now](/schools-now "Schools Now") across the province, we are creating better learning opportunities and bringing school closer to home.

## Program commitment

More than 100 new and updated schools for Alberta students.

Through an investment of $8.6 billion, we will create more than 100 new and updated schools – about 200,000 student spaces – over the next 7 years.

We will create the new student spaces by:

  * building up to 90 new schools
  * modernizing or replacing up to 24 existing schools
  * expanding the modular classroom program
  * expanding public charter school builds

## Accelerated school construction

As part of the program, we have also made improvements to our funding process to speed up the construction of new schools. Funding for projects that are ready to proceed to the next step can be approved without having to wait for the next budget cycle, saving valuable time for Albertans.

This new process is paying off, and we have accelerated 33 previously announced school projects across the province.

  * 11 projects were approved to move to the next stage in May 2025.
  * 11 projects were approved for full construction funding in February 2025.
  * 11 school projects were approved to move to the next stage in fall 2024.
