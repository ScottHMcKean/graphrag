## Overview

Alberta's Environmental Science Program (AESP) coordinates reporting of scientifically credible data and information about the condition of Alberta's environment, as required under section 15.1 (1) of the [_Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act_](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/e12) (EPEA).

Led by the [Chief Scientist](/office-of-the-chief-scientist), the AESP collaborates with other levels of government, academic institutions, industry, non-profit organizations, and Indigenous and local communities to enable monitoring and reporting on the condition of Alberta's environment.

The AESP is guided by a multiple evidence-based approach that braids scientific, Indigenous and community-based knowledge to support environmental sustainability and conservation in Alberta.
