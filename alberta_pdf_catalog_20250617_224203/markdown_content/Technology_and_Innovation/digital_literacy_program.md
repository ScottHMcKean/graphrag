#  Digital literacy program 

Gain the skills to work, learn, and socialize online. 

## Overview

Digital literacy is essential for anyone interested in working, learning, shopping, or accessing services online. It covers a range of skills like using the internet, saving and sharing information, and protecting yourself from scams or other online threats.

The [Alberta Digital Literacy Program](https://digitalliteracy.alberta.ca/) can help Albertans gain the confidence and skills they need to engage with our increasingly digital world. This free, self-guided program is available to anyone looking to build or improve their existing digital literacy skills.

The Alberta Digital Literacy Program offers 2 levels of programming:

  * **Beginner** – This programming is designed for individuals with little to no experience using a computer. 
    * It has 10 modules that outline basic concepts like using the internet, setting up an email address, and sharing information online.
  * **Intermediate** – This programming is designed for individuals who want to grow their existing digital literacy. 
    * It has 9 modules that outline more complex concepts like understanding digital footprints, staying safe online, and learning or shopping online.



You can choose to complete both courses in their entirety or just the modules that interest you the most. Each module is designed to be completed in 10 to 30 minutes.

## Get started
