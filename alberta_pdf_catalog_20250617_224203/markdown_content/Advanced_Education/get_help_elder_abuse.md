## What elder abuse is

Elder abuse includes any intentional or reckless act or wilful and negligent disregard, occurring within a relationship of family, trust or dependency, directed at someone 65 years of age or older, that:

  * causes physical, emotional or psychological harm
  * involves the misappropriation or misuse of money or other personal possessions or personal or real property
  * subjects an individual to non-consensual sexual contact, activity or behaviour
  * fails to provide the necessities of life



  * ### Common types of elder abuse

The most common types of elder abuse are:

    * financial
    * emotional
    * physical
    * sexual
    * neglect
    * medication

Some of the most common types of abuse Albertans experience are emotional, financial and neglect. For more information, see [Facts on Elder Abuse](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/facts-on-elder-abuse).

  * ### Other factors

    * Elder abuse is often committed by someone known to the victim who is in a position of power, trust or authority. The most common perpetrator for older adults who experience emotional or physical abuse, is a current or former partner. In case of neglect of financial abuse, adult children are often the most likely perpetrators.
    * Elder abuse is often impacted by the mental and physical conditions of both the abuser and the victim. These factors interact in ways uniquely dependent on the individuals involved and the situation.
    * Social isolation is one of several risk factors in elder abuse situations. A [social isolation resource kit](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/social-isolation) is available to help raise awareness and understanding of social isolation.

## Helplines and supports

Call 911 if you or someone you know is being abused and is in immediate danger.

  * ### What to do if you think you are being abused

**Leave the situation if you are in immediate danger**  
Go to a safe place, such as with a neighbour, friend or relative. Go into a business or when calling a helpline ask to be taken to a shelter. If you are unable to leave your home, call 911 immediately.

**Confide in someone you trust and tell them about what is happening**  
This could be a friend or family member, public health nurse, social worker, home care worker, someone at your place of worship, or a doctor.

**Keep a record**  
Write down what is happening to you and keep a daily record. This will help you to document the abuse and help others assist you if you need it.

**Take legal action**  
All forms of abuse are wrong. Some forms are illegal. You may want to think about a court protection order that would stop the abusive person from having contact with you. Your local police service or a police-based victim services unit can give you information.

**Don't blame yourself**  
No one deserves to be abused, it is not your fault and help is available. Many groups in your community want to help you protect your rights, safety and dignity.

  * ### Help for victims

The Criminal Code of Canada sets out a variety of criminal offences that can occur in the context of elder abuse. These include offences such as

    * physical or sexual assault
    * offences against the rights of property, such as property theft, forgery and extortion
    * breach of trust and fraud

While no one ever expects to be a victim of crime, it is important to know that [help is available for victims of crime](/help-for-victims-of-crime).

If you have been a victim of crime, your first step is to call the police. They will investigate the crime and refer you to a victim services unit for assistance. Victim services units are staffed with trained, caring people who offer information, assistance and support to victims during the police investigation and throughout the criminal justice process.
