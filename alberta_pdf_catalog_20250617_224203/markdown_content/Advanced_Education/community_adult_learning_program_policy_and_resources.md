Government resources help Community Adult Learning Program (CALP) providers develop and deliver programs to adult learners.

Watch this video about how community adult learning helps.

The following information is for providers who work with adult literacy and foundational learners.

## CALP Policy Manual

These policies help make sure organizations receiving CALP funding:

  * are familiar with the intent of the program
  * understand government requirements and expectations



Policies balance government requirements with an understanding that every community requires a unique approach to addressing adult foundational learning needs.
