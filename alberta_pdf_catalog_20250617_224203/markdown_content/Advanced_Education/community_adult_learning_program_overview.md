1 in 5 adult Albertans face daily literacy and numeracy challenges.

See why it’s important for you or your family members to be able to read and write:

  * [family life](https://youtu.be/RksWGt-bIM4)
  * [success at work](https://youtu.be/N-RCz2TIyL4)



Almost half of working age (45%) Albertans do not have the literacy skills required to perform most jobs in today’s economy reliably and consistently. (Skills in Canada: First Results from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) [**The case for literacy**](https://cwf.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CWF-The-Case-for-Literacy-in-Alberta-Report-April-2023-WEB.pdf).)
