## Introduction

Community Adult Learning programs (CALP) provide non-formal foundational learning opportunities in the areas of literacy, numeracy, basic digital skills, English language learning and skills for learning for adults with unmet learning needs living in Alberta.

Reading and writing are important, but literacy is about your using those skills to improve your life and actively participate in your community and society. Part-time learning can help you strengthen your literacy and other essential skills.

You need literacy skills to:

  * get and use information effectively
  * make informed choices about:
    * work
    * health care
    * parenting
    * household finances
    * voting



Part-time classes can help you improve your literacy or other learning skills.
