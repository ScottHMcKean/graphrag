# A new mission: helping heroes find civilian success

Alberta’s government is helping connect former military and public safety personnel with meaningful civilian careers.

Members of the Canadian Armed Forces and public safety personnel embody strength, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to service. Whether protecting the country abroad or ensuring the safety of communities at home, these individuals have made immense sacrifices in the name of duty. As their time in uniform comes to a close, Alberta’s government is committed to standing behind them – just as they have stood for us.

Transitioning to civilian life can present unique challenges, especially when it comes to finding meaningful employment that reflects the skills and leadership developed through service. To help ease this transition, Alberta’s government is investing $1.2 million in Prospect Human Services’ Forces@WORK program, which provides specialized supports to help former military and public service personnel rejoin the workforce.

> “Our government is committed to ensuring that veterans and public safety personnel have the support they need to build meaningful careers beyond their service. Through this partnership, we’re honouring Alberta’s heroes by helping them transition into rewarding careers in the civilian workforce.”
> 
> _Jason Nixon, Minister of Assisted Living and Social Services_

> “Every Albertan deserves an opportunity to pursue meaningful employment, especially those who have served our country as public safety personnel or in the Canadian Armed Forces. This funding will make it possible for more veterans and former public safety personnel to connect with jobs that fit within their needs and contribute their success.”
> 
> _Joseph Schow, Minister of Jobs, Economy, Trade and Immigration_

> “As military liaison, I know the immense value of former military and public safety personnel’s unique skill sets. The strength, determination, and discipline developed in their line of work are valuable assets to any industry. This investment helps ensure those strengths are recognized and supported as they transition into meaningful civilian careers.”
> 
> _Justin Wright, Alberta government’s Military Liaison to the Canadian Armed Forces_

The transition from military and public safety careers to civilian employment often involves addressing both personal and professional factors, such as physical, psychological, or emotional barriers, as well as the need to adapt highly specialized skills to new work environments. The Forces@WORK program is specifically designed to address these challenges and help participants move forward with confidence as they enter the next chapter of their careers.

Participants receive individualized assessments and customized supports tailored to their unique experiences and goals. The program offers a range of services, including peer support, career planning, job search assistance, resume and interview preparation, on-the-job training opportunities, as well as ongoing support to help maintain long-term employment. By addressing both the practical and personal aspects of career transition, Forces@WORK helps ensure participants are able to find fulfilling work and are well-equipped for success in the civilian workforce.

> “The Forces@WORK program is life-changing, helping veterans and public safety personnel overcome physical and psychological challenges during career transitions. Forces@WORK changed my life after I medically retired following 25 years in the Canadian Army, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to help others through the program now. Prospect is pleased to partner with the provincial government, so that more Albertans are able to benefit from the same support I have.”
> 
> _Major (retired) David Blackburn, senior manager of program operations and director of military employment services, Prospect Human Services_

> "Within OSI-CAN Alberta, a common belief amongst new participants is that their skills are not relevant for the civilian workforce. Being able to connect them to the Forces@WORK program provides them hope and reassurance. Before long, they’ve found meaning and purpose through a follow-on career, thanks to the work done by this important program."
> 
> _Sergeant (retired) Jason Trenholm, provincial services coordinator, OSI-CAN_
