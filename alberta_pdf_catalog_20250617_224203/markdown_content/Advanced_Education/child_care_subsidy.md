#  Child care subsidy 

Subsidies are available to offset the cost of child care for eligible families. 

Explore pages in:

[For parents and families](/accessing-child-care)

  * [Finding and choosing child care](/about-child-care-in-alberta)
  * Child care subsidy 



## Overview

Eligible families can apply for child care subsidies if they have children in full-time kindergarten or grades 1 to 6 enrolled in a:

  * licensed facility-based child care program
  * family day home program overseen by a licensed family day home agency
  * group family child care centre



Subsidy rates vary based on family income, the child care program and the number of hours a child attends each month. Types of subsidies include:

  * subsidy for children in full-time kindergarten enrolled in a licensed program outside of regular school hours
  * subsidy for children in Grades 1-6 enrolled in a licensed child care program
  * extended hours subsidy for children who require care outside regular hours



## Subsidy types and rates

A child's subsidy rate is determined by total family income, the child’s current grade, type of child care program, and the number of hours the child attends in a month. Use Line 15000 from the most recent Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Notice of Assessment to determine gross household income.

  * ### Subsidy for Kindergarten to Grade 6 (child care outside school hours)

A school age child's subsidy rate is determined by total family income, grade the child is attending, the child care program, and the number of hours the child attends in a month.

Families earning under $90,000 gross annually with children in full-time kindergarten to Grade 6 enrolled in a licensed program outside of regular school hours are eligible for child care subsidy.

Review the eligibility requirements for more information on how to qualify for subsidy and how to calculate your total family income. Additionally, find out if you are an individual who is temporarily not required to file a Canadian tax return to qualify, and what to do in the event of a recent reduction in income.

The table below shows the subsidy amounts based on income, grade the child is attending, and program type. Children must attend the minimum number of hours to receive the maximum subsidy rate listed under the family’s income bracket.

**Table 1.** Maximum subsidy rates for children in full-time kindergarten to Grade 6 enrolled in a licensed child care program outside of regular school hours

Family income| Kindergarten: Facility-based care (100 hours)| Kindergarten:  
Day home and group family care (100 hours)| School age: Grades 1 to 6 (50 hours)  
---|---|---|---  
$0 to $49,999| $644| $516| $366  
$50,000 to $54,999| $612| $490| $348  
$55,000 to $59,999| $547| $439| $311  
$60,000 to $64,999| $483| $387| $275  
$65,000 to $69,999| $419| $335| $238  
$70,000 to $74,999| $354| $284| $201  
$75,000 to $79,999| $290| $232| $165  
$80,000 to $84,999| $225| $181| $128  
$85,000 to $89,999| $161| $129| $92  
  
  * ### Extended hours subsidy

The extended hours subsidy assists families who require child care outside of the regular hours of 6 am to 6 pm or on weekends to receive, in addition to the child care subsidy, an extra $100 per month per child.

    * Extended hours subsidy is available for children in full-time kindergarten to Grade 6 who are enrolled in a licensed program outside of regular school hours and approved for child care subsidy.
    * The licensed program must be approved to offer extended hours of care.
    * The child must require 4 or more hours of extended hours of care in a month for the family to receive the additional $100.

  * ### Summer subsidy rate for school-age children

To assist parents with the cost of full-day child care for children in Grades 1 to 6 in the summer months, subsidy rates will increase in July and August.

What this means for parents and caregivers:

    * If you are currently receiving subsidy and will be increasing your child care hours throughout the summer months, you will be eligible for a subsidy increase.
    * The summer school-age subsidy rate change will occur automatically and will return to the regular rate in September.
    * The subsidy rate table below shows the summer rates you can expect based on the type of program your child attends and your income.

**Table 2.** Summer school-age subsidy rates based on income

Income| Current school-age subsidy rate (Grades 1 to 6)| Summer school-age subsidy rate  
(Grades 1 to 6)  
---|---|---  
Facility-based centres| Day home and group family  
$0 to $49,999| $366| $644| $516  
$50,000 to $54,999| $348| $612| $490  
$55,000 to $59,999| $311| $547| $439  
$60,000 to $64,999| $275| $483| $387  
$65,000 to $69,999| $238| $419| $335  
$70,000 to $74,999| $201| $354| $284  
$75,000 to $79,999| $165| $290| $232  
$80,000 to $84,999| $128| $225| $181  
$85,000 to $89,999| $92| $161| $129  
| Rates reflect attendance of 50+ hours.| Rates reflect attendance of 100+ hours.  
  
For example, in June, a child in Grade 2 attending a child care program received a maximum school-age subsidy rate of $366. The subsidy rate for this child will increase to $644 for July and August to support increased attendance. The subsidy rate will return to $366 in September.

If you have any questions or require additional information about the school-age subsidy summer rates, contact the Alberta Supports Contact Centre at 1-877-644-9992.

## How to apply

Review your eligibility and apply online for the fastest processing times using a computer, tablet or mobile phone through the [Child Care Subsidy Application](https://applychildcaresubsidy.alberta.ca/).

During your application, you will need to submit the [Declaration and Canada Revenue Agency Consent form](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/CDEV0022). If you have completed this form in the past, it is not necessary to fill it out again.

Each subsidy starts at the beginning of the month your completed application is received. You can apply as early as the month before your child is starting child care. For example, if your child's start date is September 1, you can apply as early as August 1.

  * ### Review your eligibility

You can apply for child care subsidy if:

    * you or your spouse or partner, or the child receiving care, are Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada, temporary residents with a valid work permit, refugee claimants or protected person claimants (individuals unable to return to their countries of origin because they fear persecution)
    * you or your spouse or partner are an Alberta resident
    * you and your spouse or partner:
      * are working, or looking for work
      * are attending school
      * have special needs, or your child has a special need
    * your children are 12 years old or younger, and attending full-time kindergarten (5 days per week) or Grades 1-6
    * your children have a secured spot in a licensed facility-based child care program, or a family day home program that is overseen by a licensed agency

The amount of subsidy you receive will depend on the grade your child is attending, type of child care program and your household income. You are eligible if:

    * Your total family income is less than $90,000 per year for children in full-time kindergarten to Grade 6 enrolled in a licensed child care program outside of regular school hours.

Income eligibility is determined by the combined amount of you and your spouse or partner's income from your most recent Notice of Assessment, issued by CRA:

    * Income is based on Line 15000 (gross income) of your tax return less amounts reported on Line 32000 (education related tax deductions), and Lines 33099 and 33199 (medical related tax deductions).

In the event of a recent loss of income, or if you and your spouse or partner were not required to file a Canadian tax return, you can contact us to request an evaluation of income and education estimates.

## After you apply

After meeting the initial requirements and submitting an online application, you will receive an estimated Child Care Subsidy amount. This estimate, based on the details you provided in your application, is preliminary and may be adjusted after a comprehensive review.

Subsidy approvals are only issued following a thorough assessment of your application. In certain situations, additional documentation may be necessary to finalize your approval. If this is the case, you will receive a conditional approval letter specifying the additional documents or actions needed to complete the process.

  * ### Approved application

If approved for a subsidy, you will receive a letter indicating the subsidy start and end date and the amount your child care program will receive on your behalf.

Approvals may take a few weeks. As long as you submit your application in the month you want subsidy to start, your savings will be retroactive to that month, no matter when you actually receive your approval letter.

  * ### Providing additional supporting documentation

If you did not submit all of your supporting documentation when you applied, you will be given a 2-month conditional approval period to submit it.

Once all necessary documents are received and approved, the subsidy may be granted for a maximum period of 12 months.

You will be responsible for returning any funds paid if all documentation is not submitted within the time period specified.

  * ### Applications that are not approved

If your application is not approved, you will receive a letter. You can request a review of a subsidy decision by submitting a [Request for a Review of a Subsidy Decision form](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/CDEV2250) within 30 days from the date of the decision.

  * ### Renew your subsidy

To continue receiving your subsidy, you must renew it before it expires. We will send you a notice to advise you of your subsidy end date and instructions for renewal.

You can renew your subsidy online by logging into your [Alberta.ca account](https://applychildcaresubsidy.alberta.ca/). 

The renewal process can be done as early as the first day of the month your subsidy expires and no later than the end of the following month. For example, if your subsidy ends on August 31, you can start the renewal process as early as August 1 and no later than September 30. 

    * Contact the Alberta Supports Contact Centre if you have questions about the subsidy renewal process. [Renewals must be completed online](https://applychildcaresubsidy.alberta.ca) or by submitting a paper application.  


  * ### Change personal information

You must report a change of information in the same month the change occurs. Changes to your information can result in an increase or decrease in subsidy benefits, or you may have to pay some of the subsidy back.

You can [report changes online](https://applychildcaresubsidy.alberta.ca/) or download and complete a [Change of Information form](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/CDEV2785) and submit it with your supporting documentation.

Changes you must report in the month they occur:

    * change in address, email address, and phone number
    * change in reason for requiring care, such as maternity leave, laid off, summer break
    * change in family structure, such as marital status, cohabiting partner, common law partner
    * decrease in annual income that may impact your subsidy benefits
    * change in eligible deductions
    * applicant or co-applicant no longer resides in Alberta
    * change in the number of children requiring care
    * change in the child care program/service
    * change in hours of child care required
    * child stops attending child care for more than one month
