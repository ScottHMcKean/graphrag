## Help prevent wildfires

If you start a wildfire, you can be charged, fined, and held liable for all costs associated with fighting the wildfire.

Don’t be that person – learn simple steps to prevent wildfires when camping, using fireworks, riding OHVs or burning debris.

Call [310-FIRE](tel:3103473) (3473) to report a wildfire in a forested area.
