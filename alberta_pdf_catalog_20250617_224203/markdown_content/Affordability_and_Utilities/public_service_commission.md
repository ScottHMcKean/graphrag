## Our responsibilities

The Public Service Commission (PSC) is the central human resource department for the Alberta Public Service (APS), providing advice and direct delivery of HR services to support the attraction and retention of qualified employees to meet the needs of Albertans.

The PSC administers key legislation, including Alberta’s Public Service Act (PSA) and associated regulations, the Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Public Service of Alberta, the Alberta Public Agency Governance Act (APAGA), and the Public Sector Compensation Transparency Act (PSCTA), while representing the Government of Alberta (GoA) as the employer in APS-related collective bargaining and other labour relations matters.

As the centralized HR service department, the PSC’s core business includes:

  * Delivering client-centered HR services, including employee relations, recruitment, workforce planning, and organizational effectiveness;
  * Leading HR policy, planning and programs, including occupational health and safety, compensation and classification services, pension and benefits, and HR data governance and analytics;
  * Representing the GoA as the employer in Collective Bargaining and leading labour relations across departments;
  * Coordinating learning, development, and talent management for the GoA, as well as employee communications and engagement strategies; and,
  * Collaborating with departments and public agencies to promote a consistent approach to agency governance and recruitment.
