#  Open Government program

Open Government is designed to improve government transparency, and ensure better collaboration between government and citizens. 

## Open Government portal

The portal is a collection of Alberta government datasets, publications and other information products available to the public. This data and information can be used to learn about how the Alberta government works, carry out research or build web apps.

The portal functions as both a library for current publications and as an archive for historic publications.
