## Our responsibilities

The Ministry of Assisted Living and Social Services works to ensure that Albertans have access to the supports and services they need to live and age well in their homes, communities and the settings that best meet their needs. It is the ministry responsible for seniors and housing.

Assisted Living and Social Services (ALSS) helps provide stability and security for vulnerable Albertans, including seniors, people with disabilities, low-income individuals and those facing homelessness, while also providing opportunities to foster independence and quality of life. This includes supporting the delivery of preventive programming and helping Albertans access disability services, homelessness supports, financial assistance and employment services, seniors supports and other social-based programs.

As the ministry responsible for housing, ALSS works to help ensure all Albertans have a place to call home. The ministry collaborates with non-profit organizations, other orders of government and the private sector to strengthen Alberta’s housing market and support the construction, maintenance and operation of affordable housing.

As the health sector ministry for continuing care, ALSS is responsible for providing Albertans with a comprehensive, holistic system of care to support the health and independence of Albertans living in their own homes, in supportive living accommodations, or continuing care homes. Under Alberta’s refocused health care system, ALSS oversees the new provincial health agency, Assisted Living Alberta.

## In focus

[Alberta Supports](/alberta-supports)

Helping people connect with a range of programs and services to meet their unique needs.

[Continuing care](/about-continuing-care)
