#  Provincial police service engagement

Stakeholders shared their ideas for what a new provincial police service in Alberta could look like. 

## Overview

We are studying the potential transition to an Alberta provincial police service. We held virtual stakeholder engagement sessions in fall of 2021 and held additional in-person meetings in 2022.

Replacing the RCMP with an Alberta provincial police service was a recommendation of the [Fair Deal Panel](/fair-deal-panel) to address Albertans’ concerns heard during public consultations in 2019 and 2020.

PwC Canada was hired in October 2020 to conduct a study and develop a proposed policing model. Their report found the concept was realistic, cost-effective and worth further study. The policing model proposes new approaches to service delivery and governance that could better address root causes of crime, increase accountability, and put more frontline personnel in communities across Alberta at equal or lower cost.

### Stakeholder engagement

Government met with stakeholders across Alberta in the fall of 2021 and continued to hold meetings throughout 2022. There were 14 virtual sessions scheduled in November and December 2021, followed by 60 in-person meetings planned for 2022. Stakeholders included:

  * municipal and Indigenous governments
  * law enforcement organizations
  * public safety partners, such as victims services organizations and rural crime watch groups



## Outcomes

What we hear will help inform the direction of government’s exploration of a provincial police service in Alberta.
