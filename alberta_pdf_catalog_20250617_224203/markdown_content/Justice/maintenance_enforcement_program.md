## Introduction

The Maintenance Enforcement Program (MEP) enforces maintenance obligations awarded in court orders and certain agreements by collecting payments from payors (those who are required to pay maintenance) and forwarding them to recipients (those who are awarded maintenance payments). Either the payor or the recipient can register for MEP – only one needs to register. For more information, see How it works.
