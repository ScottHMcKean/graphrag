## Important dates

Applications are accepted throughout the year. Projects must be received and approved prior to March 31 each year to ensure First Nations receive their full allocation.

## Overview

The First Nations Development Fund (FNDF) Grant Program was developed by First Nations and Alberta’s government as part of the First Nations Gaming Policy. It is supported by a percentage of revenues from government-owned slot machines operating in First Nations casinos in Alberta.

Only recognized First Nations with Reserve land located within the province of Alberta that have signed an [FNDF Grant Agreement](/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/ir-fndf-grant-agreement.pdf "ir-fndf-grant-agreement.pdf") are eligible to apply to the FNDF Grant Program. There are currently 47 Alberta First Nations participating in the FNDF Grant Program.

## Funding

In April of each year, the participating 47 First Nations are provided with a projected allocation of their FNDF grant funds for that fiscal year:

  * This is an estimate based on past trends and should only be used for planning purposes.
  * Annual allocations are confirmed at the end of the fiscal year when final slot machine revenue totals become available.



Payments are made monthly to open, approved projects based on actual slot machine revenues for that period.

[FNDF Funding Model](/system/files/custom_downloaded_images/ir-fndf-funding-model.pdf "ir-fndf-funding-model.pdf")

## Community benefits

Projects that receive FNDF grants are determined by community priorities set by each First Nation’s Chief and Council.

Since 2006, the FNDF has provided more than $2 billion to First Nations in support of over 5,000 economic, social and community development projects including:

  * housing projects
  * children, youth and Elders' programs
  * cultural programs
  * business start-up and expansion
  * employment and training programs



## Grant recipients

Visit the [First Nations Development Fund Grant recipients](https://www.alberta.ca/lookup/first-nations-development-fund.aspx) page to see how funds are distributed to First Nations each year.

An overview of grant funding can be found in the [current annual report](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/first-nations-development-fund-annual-report).

## How to apply

### Step 1. Read the program guidelines

[First Nations Development Fund Grant Program Guide](https://open.alberta.ca/publications/fndf-grant-program-guide-third-edition)

Program liaison officers can provide information, support and planning assistance to First Nations on how to use FNDF grant funding to address community priorities while working within the terms of the grant agreement.

### Step 2. Fill out and sign the application package

Fillable PDF forms may not open properly on some mobile devices and web browsers. See the [step-by-step guide](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/content/formopenhelp.html) or contact [PDF form technical support](/pdf-form-technical-support "PDF form technical support").

[First Nations Development Fund Grant application package](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/FNDF12384 "FNDF Grant Application")

Applications must include the following:

  * project overview including a detailed description
  * detailed budget
  * Band Council Resolution (BCR)



### Step 3. Submit the application package

Completed application packages can be e-mailed to your liaison officer or mailed to:

First Nations Development Fund  
9th Floor, Forestry Building  
9920 108 Street NW  
Edmonton, Alberta T5K 2M4

## After you apply

Once an internal review is completed, a liaison officer will make a recommendation for approval. Once the project has been approved, an approval letter will be emailed to the First Nation’s Chief and the designated First Nation contact.

​The review and approval process may take up to 8 weeks.

## Reporting

The FNDF Grant Program requires confirmation of the expenditures for the grant amount received. Reports are due by July 31**** each year for all approved FNDF projects that received grant funds by a monthly payment, transfer of paid funds, or that have deferred funds from the previous fiscal year.

There are 2 types of reports, depending on the dollar amount of the FNDF grant:

  * projects under $100K – [Grant Reporting Template](https://cfr.forms.gov.ab.ca/Form/FNDF13342 "Grant Reporting Template")
  * projects over $100K require a financial report signed by a Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA)



All FNDF grants are subject to a compliance audit by the Province of Alberta. Complete records must be maintained, including all receipts, for 5 years after the end of the project.

First Nations that do not meet reporting requirements will have future payments withheld.
