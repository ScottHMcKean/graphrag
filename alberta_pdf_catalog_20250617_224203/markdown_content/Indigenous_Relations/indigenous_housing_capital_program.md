#  Indigenous Housing Capital Program

Funding for Indigenous governments and organizations, housing providers, municipalities, and non-profits to build affordable housing. 

## Overview

The Government of Alberta is committed to supporting the development, delivery, and ownership of affordable housing by Indigenous communities for Indigenous peoples in need.

The Indigenous Housing Capital Program (IHCP) provides funding to increase the supply of affordable off-reserve, off-settlement and on-settlement housing units for Indigenous peoples.

Development of the IHCP was guided by feedback gathered from Indigenous and Indigenous-serving organizations during a 2017 provincewide engagement.
