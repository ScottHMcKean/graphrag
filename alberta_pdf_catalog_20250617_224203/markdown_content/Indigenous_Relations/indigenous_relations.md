## Our responsibilities

Indigenous Relations acts as a central point for Alberta’s government to build and maintain relationships with Indigenous Peoples, communities and organizations.

We ensure Alberta’s legal duty to consult is met. We also coordinate with other ministries, the federal government and First Nations on land-related claims and other initiatives.

In collaboration with Indigenous Peoples, communities and organizations, we promote increased social and economic opportunities through various funds and programs.

We are also leading the Alberta government’s response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action and coordinating Alberta’s response to the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Calls for Justice.
